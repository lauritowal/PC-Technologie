CrowdAnki: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778

3. Import Json Deck in your Anki  from /Anki folder
User just uses it or makes some modification to it (i.e. to notes, deck settings, deck structure or note models).
Then the user can export the deck in JSON format (accompanied by media directory with media files used in that deck) and share it with other users. For example by creating GitHub repo with it.
Commit and Push the Anki folder to this repo

# From CrowdAnki
## The current workflow could be described as following:
The user creates or imports a deck inside of Anki.
Makes some modification to it (i.e. to notes, deck settings, deck structure or note models).
Then the user can export the deck in JSON format (accompanied by media directory with media files used in that deck) and share it with other users. For example by creating GitHub repo with it.
Other people then can either modify JSON directly or import the deck to their instance of Anki and then make some modifications to it.
Original JSON then can be updated the with the changes, these people made (merging several changes together if necessary).
After that original user (and other people) can import updated deck to integrate these new changes into their collection.
